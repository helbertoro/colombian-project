    title: "GROUP TRAVEL",
    content: `
      <p>You can travel as a couple or in a small group. We have stipulated maximum group sizes based on tour focus. For example, for our trekking and hiking tours we have maximum group sizes of 12-16, depending on the trek/walks included, while for our birding tours we suggest a maximum of eight. These limits are to maximise tour safety and logistics whilst also guaranteeing the quality of the experience, which we aim to make as personalised as possible. Smaller groups ensure that you get the attention and personal interactions with locals and guides that you deserve.</p>
      <p>Additionally, many of the ecosystems and sites that we visit are incredibly fragile and small group visits can help minimize our impact on these natural spaces.</p>
