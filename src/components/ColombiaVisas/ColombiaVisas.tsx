          Great Britain, United States, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Finland,

          Upon entry to Colombia, you are typically given a standard 30-day visa
          which will cover your trip unless you specifically ask for a 60 or
          90-day visa.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-10">WHAT YOU HAVE TO SHOW ON ARRIVAL</h2>
        <p>
          You will be issued an immigration form to complete on the plane before
          landing. You should keep the green carbon copy of this form somewhere
          safe as you will need to present it on departure. If you lose it, you
          will have to fill in another form before leaving.
        </p>
        <p>Your passport must have at least six months validity.</p>
        <p>
          You will need to show proof of onward travel (usually a return flight
          ticket) and your airline may ask for this during check in. Many
          airlines and travel agents will not sell you a one-way ticket to
          Colombia knowing that proof of onward travel is a requirement upon
          arrival.
        </p>

          your Colombia visa.
