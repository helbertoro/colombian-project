            <h1>WHY THE COLOMBIAN PROJECT</h1>
            <h2>FOR COLOMBIA – WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>
              For us Colombia has always come first. Our company was founded not
              only to show Colombia to the world and give people life-changing
              experiences during their visit, but also to help in whatever way
              we can to aid a country that has been through so much and yet has
              so much to look forward to. That’s why we value our local partners
              as friends, fostering strong and lasting relationships built on
              trust, respect and integrity. We want to ensure that our operation
              brings as much positive local impact as possible, whilst
              minimizing our own travel footprint, following international
              sustainable tourism principles.
            </p>
            <h2>KNOWLEDGE</h2>
            <p>
              We are students of Colombia – its biology, geography, people and
              history are all subjects that we delve into on a daily basis,
              enabling us to create valuable and meaningful experiences for
              clients during their stay.

            <h2>SPECIALISTS</h2>
            <p>
              We consider ourselves experts in what we do with the knowledge to
              put together special interest tours no matter what the niche. We
              measure ourselves against the best and always aim to offer
              something different and better if we can, taking into account the
              small details that make all the difference.
            </p>
            <h2>MULTI-INTERESTS</h2>
            <p>
              Using our in-depth understanding of the various niches that we
              work in, we love nothing more than to combine these elements –
              whether wildlife, and adventure, or culture, gastronomy and
              history – into an unforgettable experience, all delivered
              seamlessly for the traveler.

            <h2>LUXURY TRAVEL</h2>
            <p>
              Colombia’s hotel and gastronomic offerings are growing fast and we
              make it our business to know the very best places to eat and stay
              in each destination, offering that special touch for those who are
              looking for a high-end experience. But our touches do not stop
              there: through our network of contacts we are able to provide
              those behind-the-scenes moments – the private meal with a top
              chef, a one-on-one chat with a local expert, the niche tour with
              special access to otherwise closed sites….all is possible, within
              reason!
            </p>
            <h3>COMPETITIVE PRICES:</h3>
            <p>
              We are a small company able to accommodate different types of
              budgets. Our tours are competitively priced and we are always open
              to making adjustments to align a tour budget with that of a
              client’s.

            <h3>COLOMBO – BRITISH</h3>
            <p>
              Our company’s founders are both British and this identity filters
              through much of what we do as The Colombian Project, delivering on
              our word, working from an understanding of our English-speaking
              clients’ needs, combined with the professionalism accrued through
              many years of experience in the British corporate world.
            </p>
            <h3>OPERATIONAL QUALITY</h3>
            <p>
              We have a certain way of doing things and through our years of
              experience we’ve been able to pin this down into a clear
              operational ‘identity’. We are always looking to improve our tour
              delivery through careful post-tour reviews and onboarding of all
              client feedback, making adjustments where necessary. This way
              we’ve been able to deliver successful tours for the most demanding
              of clients, again and again.

            <h2>GUIDES</h2>
            <p>
              We value our guides as fundamental to our team and they are the
              key to a great experience – hence why we spend much of our time
              interviewing, training and developing our guiding team. We ensure
              that not only are our standards of quality are being met but that
              they are achieving greater personal professional development
              through close mentoring and support.

            <h2>WORKING WITH US – OUR PRINCIPLES:</h2>
            <p>
              We are characterized by our partners, stakeholders, supply chain
              and clients by some simple but essential rules that we work by:
              dedication to our work, passion for what we do and fairness and
              honesty in our treatment of all. We make certain that these
              principles guide our aims and strategy as a business.
            </p>
            <h2>SMALL & PERSONALIZED:</h2>
            <p>
              With our small team, you will always be in communication with a
              core member of the team who will see you through your trip from
              the planning stages to its end.
