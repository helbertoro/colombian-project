        <h2>CULTURAL & NATURAL DISCOVERY</h2>
        <p>
          Colombia is blessed with abundant natural and cultural riches across
          its territory. Its diverse geography means Colombia is home to a range
          of unforgettable landscapes such as glaciers, páramo (high-altitude
          tundra), cloud forest, humid jungle, savannas, desert and coastline,
          all of which are home to an equally diverse range of indigenous
          communities and regional cultures, creating myriad of sights, smells,
          sounds and people.

          Colombia’s cities offer an exciting setting for urban exploration for
          a few days, with world-class museums, charming Spanish colonial
          districts, burgeoning gastronomic scenes and bohemian neighborhoods.
          Our cultural and natural discovery tours incorporate an enticing mix
          of experiences that showcase some of the most well-known destinations,
          whilst always looking to get under the skin of any local culture,
          landscape or urban center.

          Our tours will see you in coffee labs, tasting one of Colombia’s most
          famous exports, taking part in cooking classes where you’ll learn
          about local dishes and their ingredients, walking around beautifully
          preserved Spanish colonial plazas surrounded by 16th century
          architecture, enjoying the mountain scenery at a typical coffee
          hacienda, walking through stunning valleys and cloud forest that is
          typical of the Colombian Andes and finishing off with treks in coastal
          jungles before a well-deserved stay at a private beach hotel on the
          Caribbean.
