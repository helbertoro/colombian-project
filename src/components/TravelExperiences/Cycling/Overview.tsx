        <h2>CYCLING</h2>
        <p>
          In Colombia, cycling is more than a low-cost means of transportation;
          it’s a passion. Every day, many Colombians ride their bikes to work in
          the countryside, crossing long mountain passes in the highlands of the
          Andes, riding heavy old iron bikes, with ponchos and rubber boots.
          This is perhaps why Colombia is home to many of the strongest uphill
          cyclists in the world – the so-called ‘escarabajos’ or beetles. High
          altitude mountainous terrain and a passion for two wheels has been a
          perfect recipe for cyclists.

          So, yes, cycling in Colombia means a lot of hills! But it also means
          unimaginable landscapes and views, and unforgettable people. Traveling
          across Colombia on a bicycle will allow you to stop in towns untouched
          by tourism where life has remained unchanged for generations. Villages
          of humble, hard-working ‘campesinos’, regional flavors, traditional
          music and customs. Whether you join an MTB or a road cycling tour,
          you’ll harvest a range of images and memories that will stay in your
          mind for a long, long time.

          Crossing Colombia on a bicycle will take you to a lot of different
          regions. Depending on your route, you’ll cycle up to the high-altitude
          Cundiboyacense plateau, where Bogotá sits, to the coffee region, down
          to the flat valley of the Valle del Cauca, to the mountains of
          Antioquia or the north coast. You’ll have to cross challenging
          obstacles such as the legendary mountain pass of Letras -the longest
          climb in the world at 80km/50miles- a physical but mostly mental test.
          During the ride, however, you’ll learn about coffee and traditional
          sugarcane production. You’ll visit our national parks and the most
          iconic cities in the country. Cycling in Colombia is one of the most
          wide-ranging adventures, cycling into the heart of both Colombia’s
          traditional countryside and it’s most exciting cities.
