        <li>
          Visit one of the deepest and most visually impressive canyons in the
          world – the Canyon del Chicamocha is a joy to behold, near Bucaramanga
        </li>
        <li>
          Visit the sleepy colonial town of Barichara. Voted Colombia’s most
          beautiful town, this national heritage site is a place where one could
          easily while away several days and forget that there’s a place called
          home!
