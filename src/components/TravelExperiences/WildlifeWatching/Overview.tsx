        <h2>WILDLIFE WATCHING</h2>
        <p>
          Exploring and observing nature is where some of our most memorable
          moments take place during any trip. Colombia is the second most
          diverse country on Earth. The numbers speak for themselves: first in
          the world for bird and orchid species; second for plants, amphibians,
          butterflies and freshwater fish; third for reptiles and palms, and
          fourth for mammals. Colombia’s megadiversity in terms of flora and
          fauna is the result of a unique, varied and extreme geography that has
          created every climatic zone and habitat imaginable for animals and
          plants to flourish, in habitats many of which are in their pristine
          state. With various regions of endemism, such as the Magdalena Valley
          and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, are home to rare and endemic
          species which can only be found here. This is especially true of
          birds, orchids, palms, primates, and amphibians amongst many other
          animal and plant groups.

          Colombia’s stunning national park and protected area system is among
          the most extensive in the world and it’s where we spend most of our
          time. Working closely with biologists and other nature specialists, we
          have been able to gain special access to the best sites – some of
          which are not open to the standard traveler – to see the most
          interesting and rare species. From birds to reptiles, frogs to
          mammals, from orchids to butterflies, we cover it all.

          Our tours can range from daytime safaris in the Llanos (Eastern
          Orinoco Plains), searching for the legendary Giant Anteater, or a
          night-time trek through the Amazonian jungle to seek out nocturnal
          animals and insects, or birdwatching high up on the highest coastal
          mountain range in the world, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta,
          consideredthe planet’s most irreplaceable concentration of
          biodiversity.
