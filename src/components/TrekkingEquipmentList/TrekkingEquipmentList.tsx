          <h1>RECOMMENDED TREKKING EQUIPMENT LIST FOR A COLOMBIAN HOLIDAY</h1>
          <p>
            We’ve put together a ‘Recommended Trekking Equipment List’ for you
            to go through to check you have all the necessary kit for our
            Colombia trekking holidays. For our other type of holidays which
            include nature and adventure experiences, required equipment will be
            quite similar to the list below. Nevertheless, during the booking
            process we will send through a trip dossier that has a tour-specific
            recommended kit list to ensure that you are well informed as to what
            you will need to pack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, the clothes and equipment you need differ depending on the
            type of holiday that you’re going on, the areas you’ll be visiting,
            and the time of year that you’re travelling in.
          </p>
          <p>
            For trips to mountain towns, cities, reserves and parks you have to
            take into account the local temperatures, altitude and activities
            that you’re looking to do. We’ll provide this information during and
            after the booking process.

            TREKKING – WHAT DO I NEED?
          </div>
          <div className="collapse-content">
            <h3>FULL SERVICE TREKS</h3>
            <p>
              Our treks are full service which means we provide all camping kit
              such as tents, sleeping bags, therma-rests (sleeping mats) and
              camping-related accessories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our trek team ensures that you don’t have to carry anything (apart
              from your day pack), cook or build camp-sites during the trek
              itself. Mess and kitchen tents are provided along with various
              other implements to ensure that your camping trip is as
              comfortable as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in making sure that you are given every chance possible
              to take in your surroundings and connect with the local cultures
              and the exuberant nature that surrounds you.
            </p>
            <h3>TOP-END TREKKING AND CAMPING EQUIPMENT</h3>
            <p>
              Our equipment has been purchased recently and was selected in line
              with climatic requirements and terrain to ensure its suitability
              for each trek.
            </p>
            <p>
              An uncomfortable sleeping mat or a sleeping bag without enough
              insulation is something that can ruin a trekking holiday. We know
              because we’ve been there – that’s why we ensure the right kit for
              the trip to guarantee maximum comfort.
            </p>
            <h3>ECOSYSTEMS AND CLIMATIC ZONES THAT WE VISIT</h3>
            <p>
              Our multi-day treks normally start in sub-Andean cloud forest and
              venture up into high-Andean forest, through sub-paramo and into
              the highland paramo at over 3,800 meters above sea-level or 12,540
              feet so it’s essential that your personal kit is suitable for
              these conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ll be staying in places where temperatures fall well below
              freezing at night and snowfall is not uncommon. Full details of
              what to expect are explained once you’ve booked with us.
            </p>
            <h3>WRAP UP – CORRECTLY</h3>
            <p>
              We recommend wearing multiple layers as opposed to just one or two
              bulky items of warm clothing such as jumpers or big jackets. This
              will make it much easier to adapt to the changing temperatures in
              the various ecosystems that we’ll trek through.

            <h3>CLOTHING</h3>
            <p>
              Sheet sleeping bag – This can serve as a liner for your sleeping
              bag, though you may opt for a thermal or silk liner instead if you
              suffer from the cold.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small day-pack – This is for general use, to keep your accessories
              and water bottle at hand during the day whether it be on trek or
              sight-seeing. It should be between 30-40 litres in size.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trekking poles – These greatly reduce stress on joints and general
              muscle fatigue in your legs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Money belt – Bumbags or Fanny Packs are advised against apart from
              on trek.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assorted stuff bags – This can be a purpose-made dry bag to keep
              your electronic devices and accessories dry and organised during
              the trek – including a spare change of clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Water bottle – Needs to be at least one litre and be made of metal
              or Nalgene (plastic type). Both can be used as a hot-water bottle
              at night.
            </p>
            <p>
              Penknife – Swiss Army or Leatherman types are useful, preferably
              one with a bottle opener. This should be packed in your main/hold
              baggage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sunglasses & Glasses – Sunglasses are easily lost or broken so you
              may want to bring a cheap pair. If you wear glasses then bring a
              spare pair. Contact lenses are generally advised against due to
              the conditions and altitude, though we can talk this through with
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal First Aid kit – We’ll give you a suggested list once

              Camera, Memory cards and spare batteries – We’ll be venturing into
              areas that do not have electricity for a number of days. The cold
              also affects battery life so spare batteries are essential if you
              want to be certain of capturing the abundant natural beauty you’ll
              see on the trip!
            </p>

            <p>
              Binoculars – To enhance views, spot birds and add another
              dimension to your experience. A pair of binoculars opens up
              another world entirely when on trek!
            </p>
            <p>
              Wash bag – Containing shampoo, soap, flannel, toothbrush, paste

              Good walking boots that fit well are without doubt the most
              important part of your kit on any given trekking or walking
              holiday. We recommend that you bring boots that you have worn in
              and are comfortable with. However, if you don’t have any or are
              looking to replace an old pair then we have a few tips to help you
              make your decision:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Good quality walking boots range between 80 to 120 GBP or 120 to
                180 USD. It is wise to invest here as uncomfortable boots or low
                quality footwear may ruin an entire trip.
              </li>
              <li>
                An all-leather boot is more hardwearing and more waterproof than
                synthetic material but now there are many boot makers that use a
                mixture of leather and synthetics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Boots with a Gore-Tex lining are recommended to keep your feet
                fresh and dry at the same time. Always check to see how far up
                the ankle the lining goes so you don’t get any nasty surprises.
              </li>
              <li>
                Take as much time as you need to choose boots that are
                comfortable and remember to take a spare pair of walking socks
                with you when buying to ensure an accurate fit in the shop.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure that the boots have good ankle support – trek trails
                are typically uneven.
              </li>
              <li>
                Buy your boots as soon as possible as you will need to wear them
                in – your feet need to get accustomed to your boots as much as
                possible prior to your trip, much better than trying out new,
                tough boots on difficult terrain.
              </li>
              <li>
                Research into hiking footwear by reading reviews and impartial
                advice. Choosing your footwear based on the fact they are a big
                brand doesn’t automatically mean they’ll be right for you.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure that your boot has a good quality sole. The shop
                should be able to advise you on this.
              </li>

            <p>
              Although there are places in Colombia where you can hire equipment
              for the trek, they are few and far between and the equipment is
              typically limited. We always recommend that you bring your own
              clothing and equipment with you as detailed above.
            </p>
